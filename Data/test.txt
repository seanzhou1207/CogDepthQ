347	adjudicated	4	As you're looking at the competitive landscape now that the major consolidations are done, how do you see this changing the way you're thinking about your capacity over the next year? So have you already planned for this?
388	adjudicated	3	When we get to the end of the year, networking capital should be hopefully $40 million positive on the cash flow statement?
475	adjudicated	1	Just within your portfolio of North American businesses and the various lines and the markets you've got there, do you watch one or two or three as particular leading indicators?
405	adjudicated	3	And then on the carbon pitch side, are there any areas or regions where you're seeing particular pressure on the pricing or are there other areas where you're seeing more favorable pricing?
126	adjudicated	3	Have you seen that at all have an impact or discussions with retailers? Or has it really been more weather and timing of tax refunds?
281	adjudicated	2	Can we get an update on how the costs are doing at Leeville?
391	adjudicated	4	Just wondering if you could remind us what your content differential is on four wheel drive versus two-wheel drive and as you have seen sort of this -- your historical performance around gas prices being incredibly low, is this kind of a mix that might stay at this level going forward?
37	adjudicated	2	And then on the Mississippi Lime, it sounds like you are going to have that on towards the end of the year or early next year, just curious with the ramp in volumes is likely to look like?
114	adjudicated	1	Do you see 2015 as the peak margin?
77	adjudicated	2	Can you maybe talk about where the breakpoints have been in conversations and what is it that's holding things up? Or is it just that the pipeline didn't pick up until 3 or 4 months ago, and it takes longer than that to make something happen?
451	adjudicated	1	So is it still some purchase accounting that you're dealing with over there?
404	adjudicated	2	Should we be thinking about that? Can you just tell us quarterly is it evenly distributed, is it more first half, second half?
471	adjudicated	3	So I guess what I'm trying to ask is, do you expect the gap that you've normally been outpacing PC shipments to kind of the gap to widen similar to what we saw this quarter versus what historicals might tell us?
455	adjudicated	4	What's going on there?
365	adjudicated	4	So how did you end up reaching it probably earlier than what people were thinking?
181	adjudicated	3	Do you see the drop in oil prices as overall a positive or negative for Huntsman over the next year?
148	adjudicated	3	Are you seeing any strength in the specialties category? Or is it mainly in just everyday dental products?
45	adjudicated	2	And you mentioned the margins were low just a quick clarify this, how much if we would talk about the revenue requirement associated with these stations is being covered by customers versus what quote, unquote the marketplace would be theoretically covering? Do you have a rough breakdown of that?
477	adjudicated	2	Just to follow-up on question on the repair tax, why would that not be an adjustment to rate base?
238	adjudicated	2	A couple of random questions, so could you perhaps breakout how much was the explicit impact of the 10% off deal that you did after the breach and right ahead of Christmas?
231	adjudicated	3	But do you have any potential changes in your financing plans for that to fund the $1 billion over 2013 and 2014?
495	adjudicated	2	What gives you confidence that you can hit those numbers?
261	adjudicated	1	Is that based on the borrowing base calculation?
324	adjudicated	3	Should you anticipate that to move back up in the fourth quarter?
39	adjudicated	2	But is there any way that you could quantify what you're seeing in terms of pricing dynamics?
494	adjudicated	3	Do you expect to sort of see those same trends this year as well?
321	adjudicated	3	On Cerro San Pedro, the grades is up and the recovery is down, is that going to continue for the course of the year, how is the trend in terms of grade and recovery?
46	adjudicated	2	And then, could you touch on just the ability to kind of flex it up or down if you see an opportunity that may be drive sales with something or maybe to pullback if it’s unnecessary to drive more profit?
227	adjudicated	2	Why the auction route on those versus bilaterals, which you've got on your other Brazil hydros? Was that necessary, given the nature of those?
470	adjudicated	2	Just curious on just your OE bookings, what kind of magnitude are you looking at in terms of potential pricing declines in that business today?
450	adjudicated	4	So can you just help us sort of bridge the gap between the 2 in terms of the outlook?
316	adjudicated	1	How much did Japan cost you in this quarter, the outage?
55	adjudicated	3	What I'm asking is, do you need to, as you grow your parts availability and your frequencies of delivery, add more sales in order to sort of educate and get that message out there?
304	adjudicated	2	Can you kind of flush out, number one, what's your seeing in terms of meter demand and meter placements?
5	adjudicated	4	You said it was a mix between 3D tomo and Panther pull-through. Can you talk about the mix between both of those back, forward, and how is that going to impact 2014 and how we think about guidance going there?
332	adjudicated	2	I got part of that, but if you could repeat your question I want to make sure we get it?
57	adjudicated	2	Is that something that is still progressing? Or is it more at this point, let's get the first one locked up under construction, and then we'll, perhaps, assess a twinning at that point?
24	adjudicated	2	How do you locked in the liquid bitumin-- liquid asphalt cost for the rest of the year or you're still at vaguaries of what that price does?
437	adjudicated	2	Could you give us a little color on where in emerging markets you're gaining traction?
268	adjudicated	2	What keeps you in Washington and New Mexico instead of shopping those systems around?
465	adjudicated	2	In which verticals are they being delayed?
92	adjudicated	3	I know it's a function of commodity prices, but do you guys expect to use the 3x debt to EBITDA sort of a throttle such that we would either have to look at slowing activity or doing more asset sales in terms to keep the leverage below that ratio?
209	adjudicated	3	I mean should we think about that being a regional EBIT mix perspectively given the new land openings?
76	adjudicated	4	For the theater acquisition in the second quarter, what was the cap rate? And can you give us an update on what you’re seeing in terms of the acquisition environment, what’s in you pipeline and the competition you are seeing?
320	adjudicated	1	The rejected gas, is that coming out maybe as 1,100 BTU? And does that present any issues on the midstream side, especially with Anadarko doing the same thing?
248	adjudicated	2	And a lot of people have talked about that business trending down, how are you seeing that for you how does that part looks like?
334	adjudicated	3	What's the timeframe under which we should be expecting kind of the full benefits to flow through for both Hawesville and Sebree if you could?
408	adjudicated	4	So can you discuss what the long-term, as more of the pharmaceutical market and the value of the pharmaceutical market moves to specialty drugs? Is that sort of the underlying or part of the underlying reason for this agreement long-term strategically?
94	adjudicated	4	So can you maybe reflect on the changes that you've made into the organization, the opportunities that you have here, and maybe is it just a matter of having to wait another year to see that margin improvement pull through?
180	adjudicated	2	First, in the near-term, did you see any impact from the back-to-school tax-free shifts for the later Labor Day?
464	adjudicated	4	Could you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics in that key application processor versus some other areas there that you guys might have less competition and more differentiation?
118	adjudicated	2	So is there anything in there that I might have missed in terms of guidance for FX?
394	adjudicated	2	How often you guys evaluate the portfolio in terms of thinking about any potential new exits that you might be thinking for 2015 that aren't necessarily in the existing core sale outlook for 2015?
417	adjudicated	1	Maybe can you ballpark it, you have given us, I think it was 14 million or 15 million of EBITDA?
237	adjudicated	2	Can you maybe just put a little bit more color around the acceleration year-over-year?
290	adjudicated	2	Is there some level of motorcycle financing where you guys get uncomfortable with bearing sort of most of those loans or where it starts to constrain sales or is there sort of no bound on that?
66	adjudicated	2	Are you suggesting or setting us to expect that each of those groups of processes including the innings four to six to follow on tools, is that from a duration standpoint?
438	adjudicated	4	What's the plan proposed to A-17 well?
489	adjudicated	1	Larry, just to clarify that last point, the 55% is where you are today, or that's where you would expect to be in 2016?
86	adjudicated	2	Maybe you could just kind of walk us through your thought process there and your desire to slow that down, are your current inventory tests and field tests and delivery tests part of this?
108	adjudicated	1	That's a year-over-year example though, right?
75	adjudicated	4	So what do you think the retailers are thinking, are they putting off taking deliveries and do that increase the risk in the fourth quarter?
336	adjudicated	2	Could you give us an update on the progress you have made around the facility consolidation efforts that are planned for the year?
406	adjudicated	3	I am just interested in knowing if how you guys think about deploying capital into buying pre-FID barrels versus putting more capital into exploration with that or anything you would be interested in doing?
333	adjudicated	4	If any of you could share some thoughts of within the business model, which end markets do you think CVG has got the strongest competitor position and where there's places that you may need to bolster it someway?
42	adjudicated	3	But given where interest rates are now, I imagine the underfunded position comes down quite a bit, does that mean that you have less cash outflow in the next couple of years and we could actually -- you'll see nice free cash flow growth just on the back of that going forward?
485	adjudicated	4	You called out pricing earlier in your commentary and I wonder how important at this point is pricing, have you been trying to implement new pricing strategies within RBI and if that's one of the more difficult things to implement to get the culture change?
168	adjudicated	2	I guess, kind of going back to the first question is on mobile, twofold on devices, am I correct, is it solely content gains which give you the bullish view on the second half of the year versus a better volume outlook for the device market?
381	adjudicated	3	Is there any way that you can kind of ballpark the incremental margins on the organic volume growth, just so we can get a sense of, you know what I mean, how strong of a component that is to the overall improvement?
192	adjudicated	1	And just as to clarify your goal is to grow at least 5% on average each year right?
182	adjudicated	3	Could you please address the tax rate issue? How long can you keep it at 25%? Will it go up in the future year?
203	adjudicated	2	Why no change or move away from the 5% to 6% growth for this year?
428	adjudicated	2	Could you just dive in a little bit more, was there something unique that was going on that's driving this increase?
93	adjudicated	4	Are you setting the bar that high because of the expense or could you shed some more light on what you think about your PCSK9 inhibitor base and what you've seen to date, and what's sort of the go, no go decision it will be based upon?
117	adjudicated	3	Do you expect to sell more or less than last year? Is there any way you can kind of guide us there, please?
25	adjudicated	4	Now that you've sold the Refinery and the E&P business, how do you think about MDU's overall exposure to oil prices, whether it be the Construction businesses, Utility customer growth, Midstream?
497	adjudicated	2	Are you seeing any incremental impact from some of the small business initiative or an effort in the intel community to reduce the contractor content?
265	adjudicated	4	Is that -- where is your sense of that kind of stabilizing? And is that the manifestation of kind of industry trends? How should we think of it?
249	adjudicated	2	Just give us a color, you buy alumina in Kentucky and you buy alumina in Grundartangi, how are these set up? Are these connected to all-in-aluminum price or is this API index of just LME price? Can you give us some color?
423	adjudicated	2	The growth that you're anticipating for the second half of the year in the Crane business, is that based on just macro and sort of historical trends?
374	adjudicated	2	And so, I was just curious what that 70% meant in terms of utilization or how you're thinking about that number, what it's related to?
69	adjudicated	3	So could you spend some time talking about where those reductions are coming from and how we should think about the trend, not just this year but going forward?
0	adjudicated	2	When do you expect Minnesota rates to kick in?
67	adjudicated	2	When you look at the Family Dollar stores that have been selected for conversions, how would you characterize the quality of their locations by Dollar Tree standards?
375	adjudicated	2	What is your assumed ROE at the regulated businesses?
90	adjudicated	2	And just in terms of this refinancing, given the size of your cash balance, why not just pay down the debt outright?
318	adjudicated	2	And then I think I missed the endpoint that you talked about earlier, so if you can just repeat that, that would be great?
409	adjudicated	2	As far as our guidance, is there a meaningful impact there?
493	adjudicated	2	So I was just wondering, as you look at the portfolio, are there other opportunities that you can kind of cure the portfolio a little bit more value as you look longer term?
262	adjudicated	4	And I understand visibility is probably a bit limited into March, but it seems like most industry folks have talked about March maybe being a little bit of a tougher comp given the fare increased activity that started to take hold last year, so how should we be thinking about the March comp for JetBlue?
280	adjudicated	2	Why don't you add a little bit of color here?
208	adjudicated	2	How far along are you at this point in the evaluation process?
433	adjudicated	2	How should we think about inventory pacing through the second quarter as you move into some of the other movie releases?
173	adjudicated	2	What states you're watching and what states may be you're most hopeful or even optimistic in? Specifically maybe your thoughts on Tennessee, Virginia and Florida?
194	adjudicated	1	Is there precedent that you're aware of that if you do have to get a license amendment, whether you can operate while you're going to the filing process to get that amendment?
109	adjudicated	2	If you're thinking that you'd do one or both, what should we be thinking about there?
60	adjudicated	4	So can you quantify that this dovetails what you were just talking about and if you can quantify what the impact might be on your capital plan if you were therefore necessitated to pick up your pro rata share of the capacity shortfall?
377	adjudicated	3	Is that the right way to think about your business once we start to see volumes increase on a year-over-year basis? And if so, is that incremental margin framework only achievable at coal environment that's at least flat or stabilized?
211	adjudicated	3	Do you think that, that has any impact longer term on the pricing structure of the business in general or the product itself?
220	adjudicated	2	Can you just maybe talk about some of the leverage you've been pulling and talk about some of the current initiatives, like the shared services center?
