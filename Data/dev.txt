104	adjudicated	3	So, should we expect restructuring cost to decline materially in 2017?
440	adjudicated	2	Can you talk about maybe how much overall revenue impact it truly has been?
479	adjudicated	4	So are you -- how does that work out? Are you seeing more deals coming your way, but they're just asking too much money? Or how do you see this market kind of evolving right now?
266	adjudicated	4	How do you think about that now? How you think about 2013?
132	adjudicated	3	So just as the housing market at large I think in general has been below expectations as people coming into the year has that impacted you know how much land you're willing to spend on this year?
253	adjudicated	2	Your comment that you are just going to see higher AMI shipments, can you just tell us what you're seeing in the markets generally and in terms of tenders?
9	adjudicated	2	Can you update us on your mature field strategy, the opportunities you are seeing in this market?
323	adjudicated	1	Is that what you were suggesting, is you've got an unusually large volume of contracts coming up for renewal?
335	adjudicated	1	You guys are still active in future years?
23	adjudicated	1	I'm just wondering how far out you guys generally plan for, three, five, eight, ten years?
26	adjudicated	3	What do you expect there for 2015 and do you have any visibility to that showing some growth next year or this year?
361	adjudicated	4	And a follow-up question, as consumers continue to migrate more online to buy their products, how does your delivery of innovation change with that dynamic of consumers buying more online?
152	adjudicated	1	The other question I had was on Indonesia and there some reports have indicated recently that you guys have agreed to a transition from a COW to a special mining license and I guess first of these reports accurate?
16	adjudicated	3	Do you expect operating profit in sweeteners to hold steady in 2014 given the fructose pricing?
352	adjudicated	4	Given all the puts and takes there and what you're seeing in the commodity market, how should we think about that line over the next year?
153	adjudicated	3	Just to begin, I want to know if - just to dig a little bit deeper on the guidance, can you -- when you're looking at your H2 outlook, how dependent are you on new programs versus -- excuse me, for the calendar second half -- how dependent are you on these programs versus better market demand? And are you counting on any programs that you have yet to win for the optimistic view that you have for the second?
79	adjudicated	3	I guess hypothetically if we were to assume that given your relationships with all three companies, that if you are able to continue manufacturing those devices, would you foresee any changes in pricing as it relates to the deal?
33	adjudicated	4	So, I wouldn't think there'd be a whole lot of risk at the downside, but given your confidence, just wondering where you guys could see the different leverage moving that could create numbers outside that range?
29	adjudicated	3	But are you, conceptually are you thinking that you would maintain some level of ownership in that company or you think you are spinning the whole entity in to a new standalone company?
101	adjudicated	4	And then separately, how do you think about raw material inflation across the businesses in '14 versus '13?
384	adjudicated	3	What is it that needs to happen for that digital shift to occur? Do you need more rights? You just need more devices in the market?
331	adjudicated	2	What's the rationale for buying back stock rather than increasing dividend?
357	adjudicated	2	Could you give us a little sense of what's going on there since it performed above the chain average? Is it national brands?
3	adjudicated	2	Is the market that strong or are you gaining market share in that region?
461	adjudicated	1	And I was also wondering, have you spoken to the rating agencies at all regarding all these issues that have taken place over the last few months?
356	adjudicated	2	And I guess to tie it back to the dividend discussion, does it any way hang over that discussion as well or do you see it as more of an isolated risk rather than part of the ongoing capital deployment strategy?
454	adjudicated	3	With respect to the $70 million in redeployed spending, how will you measure success?
222	adjudicated	4	Can you talk about maybe the moving parts heading into the 2016 guidance on the volume front, how you think that's playing out and what some of the opportunities are that can drive you to the high end or above?
82	adjudicated	2	As a leading indicator, though, are you seeing any interest from your customers on the Well Service side, or Production Services side or still not even there yet?
63	adjudicated	2	Maybe what gives you that confidence? I am assuming your studies are not, perhaps, even nearing completion, you talked about it being delivered by the first half and so maybe if you could give us a bit more color there, if you don’t mind, unless we have to wait for the study?
453	adjudicated	3	If that those huge numbers that talked by Apache did not materialize and end up to be smaller, you still won't willing that you have to integrate model that including the ownership in the resource?
11	adjudicated	2	But would you say that the recent growth rate there is a good proxy for the go forward run rate, where it seems to be growing faster than some of your other expense line items and growing faster than revenue?
431	adjudicated	3	If you could just comment on what's going on there; is it the projects that are in backlog, the burn rate is lower than what you would have thought?
462	adjudicated	1	So like, is the first quarter disproportionately high versus the year or you just divide the $50 million by 4?
185	adjudicated	2	So what do you think explains your ability to sort of keep the market flattish? Is it just where you're at?
17	adjudicated	2	Could you guys expand on the sequential improvement in orders? Was most of it being driven by improvement from the OEMs? Or is it more distribution?
155	adjudicated	2	We know they kind of come in and come out of favor so what markets are really driving group demand these days?
56	adjudicated	4	What is causing it to be lower sequentially if trends are getting much better?
410	adjudicated	2	So it's like -- I guess what I'm getting at is just the difference between the -- the difference in the differentials, the new change in production, is that what offsets this?
271	adjudicated	2	Yet another follow-up on repowering, can you provide a little additional color on how you selected those specific 327 megawatts out of the portfolio?
390	adjudicated	2	First of all, just looking at some of the Asia commentary, can you talk a little bit more in detail about the high volume mix?
144	adjudicated	4	Can you talk about your completions contract and the strategy for keeping them busy? Do those contracts roll? Or are they longer term?
141	adjudicated	3	And then you did mention in your formal comments some of the things that the private equity sponsor had done to improve that business in Europe, just wondering if that improvement was more a function of productivity and cost outs or do they also grow the business, you could talk about maybe the growth trends for Mactac Europe in the last couple of years and how it looks going forward based on your due diligence?
22	adjudicated	2	Okay. Yet -- but that being said, you're still comfortable with the new guidance that you gave today?
154	adjudicated	1	You kind of land positions and kind of A, B, C, D locations and Ara, you mentioned in the prepared remarks about how you were significantly bigger in a similar geographic footprint?
2	adjudicated	1	Is there a target for coverage?
124	adjudicated	1	Is the marginal cardholder of similar credit quality characteristics and the applicant to card approval rate similar as well?
137	adjudicated	2	I was wondering if you could talk about where the technology in your established international ticketing business stands relative to domestic?
472	adjudicated	2	And secondly, I just wanted to know where we stand today?
172	adjudicated	3	Just wanted to see at this if you're comfortable on giving a little more color on those plans and then what that could imply for CapEx here in 2016?
373	adjudicated	1	It sounds like priorities are organic, then possibly projects and last on the list sort of whole portfolio company type things?
195	adjudicated	3	How much of that do you believe is shorter term in nature or timing in nature versus how much do you think is more of a secular issue?
278	adjudicated	1	Was that a $9 million retroactive tax gain, did I hear?
68	adjudicated	3	And the follow-up is, middle of last year there was plan to get to investment grade by middle of ’16 maybe late ‘16 how has that plan changed with the commodity coming down now?
84	adjudicated	2	But when can we read through on that in terms of your demand? I mean obviously if prices are going up because coal tar demand is going up, is that a positive for you guys, outside of the cost inflation?
78	adjudicated	3	So, on that theme of growth, you obviously have some specific items that directly work against you and are pretty significant in size and scale that will probably preclude you from having organic growth for the next couple of years, I'd imagine, do you not see that being the case?
157	adjudicated	3	But more broadly, are you maybe disappointed with the pace of improvement in rate and margins in the business overall?
113	adjudicated	1	Did you disclose what the amount of the RDM true-up of MichCon was in the second quarter? Or could you, if you didn't?
30	adjudicated	4	Specifically any color on how industry pricing has been impacted, the prospects for future consolidation or just how competitors maybe thinking about fleet growth going forward?
277	adjudicated	4	You have built one of the most profitable companies in technology as measured by operating margins and I guess I just wanted to ask, how we should think about the puts and takes you see as related to Oracle's non-GAAP operating margin expansion as you look out over the next two to three years?
175	adjudicated	3	Now, do we think that if we take a look at a cradle to grave perspective of their total dollars to spend, do we think if we can talk a look at that, we can save them expenditures in terms of reach and effectiveness?
140	adjudicated	3	But looking beyond the lower, sort of Q1 fixed cost allocations and what already know about dairy prices, to what extent does that lower gross margin outlook also reflect of you that the competitive and the promotional environment could be sustainably a bit more intense than you originally envisioned?
7	adjudicated	3	Do you think, as you look forward, that you would grow on-par with overall square footage growth for the flooring category, or would you be plus or minus that?
275	adjudicated	4	Can you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of customer adoption of Fusion? What are you seeing in terms of uptake, at least within the installed base, upgrades, number of go-lives?
483	adjudicated	2	Is that just because you want to give confidence or get confidence that there's enough time to separate between the curves? Is that what you're thinking?
193	adjudicated	3	And if that's the case, I mean I'm assuming that would lead to higher potential artificial margin improvement, if you will, on future sales? Is that right?
229	adjudicated	1	But are there fewer offsets in the fourth quarter?
72	adjudicated	3	If you start to execute on more of this stuff, how should we think about financing and what kind of metrics you want to be at? Would you need any equity if you hit all this stuff?
145	adjudicated	1	To put it in context, just like you said on that slide, are these the right numbers?
204	adjudicated	3	And turning to the EU, can you help us quantify the impact you expect to see as you adopt your shifts and go-to market strategy and as you increase the number of countries that will be transitioning, what that impact will go to?
415	adjudicated	3	Your sort of optimism or your upbeat note on Oil & Gas, within your mix, would you say that market share gains wise you stand pretty well but the fab yards?
312	adjudicated	3	On this quarter, how do you accelerate traffic online, and anything to account for the moderation that we saw over the last three months?
491	adjudicated	2	Also, can you describe some of the key DPP-4 market dynamics such as how long patients typically remain on DPP-4 therapy before adding therapies or switching to other therapies?
18	adjudicated	3	Can you just review for us where silicone hydrogel daily as a category is today just from a market standpoint? And where do you think it can go over time?
110	adjudicated	1	Is there a product line or specific or is it just more of a regional function where you're seeing the growth?
400	adjudicated	1	And the storm cost, I think you said $2 million to $4 million or $4 million to $6 million, what did you say?
329	adjudicated	1	Are they running across Facebook and Instagram?
70	adjudicated	3	So, if you go back a year to the fourth quarter of 2014, what percentage of those bookings were done for 2015 versus all future periods? In other words, is it really higher occupancy that’s going to hurt you going into the fourth quarter this year, or how do we think about all future periods?
218	adjudicated	2	And whether there are additional opportunities to expand that further globally?
272	adjudicated	2	On LiveTV, can you just talk to the way that the services -- how are you going to pay for the service in the future? Is it on an aircraft basis?
73	adjudicated	2	When you say begin the roll out, do I take that to mean some will be out by the end of the year but not all?
131	adjudicated	2	So if I can first, am I missing anything big in terms of the drivers? You talked about, I think lapping high promo expenses, benefits in cost savings, the least amount of inflation in the year, anything large that I am missing there?
426	adjudicated	1	Is that your expectation as well?
31	adjudicated	2	Could you just give us a little bit more color on Gulfstream? Because from our vantage point, I don't know of anything that's going down.
116	adjudicated	2	I understand that 4% range we are hoping to do with wholesale growth and cost control and the 7% range we are hoping to do it with accretive acquisitions, but I wonder if you just might give more color on how you close that gap?
322	adjudicated	2	And then on -- you talked about Stonewall quite a bit, can you help us get a better idea of what the net cost is for you all to move gas on that system?
15	adjudicated	1	As you look out your CapEx over the next few years, does that ratio of bleach and HCL get much higher?
247	adjudicated	3	Can you give us any idea like revenue decline first half versus second half or anything to help us figure that out?
414	adjudicated	2	Just want to clarify on that earlier question regarding market share, should we assume that your guidance does imply a little bit share gain at the back half of the year?
317	adjudicated	3	Can you give us some sense as to, obviously you talked about being able to cover the dividend in future years, so can you talk about the moving parts from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 in terms of free cash, and how much higher one can reasonably expect your cash flow to be next year?
176	adjudicated	4	Can you give us a quick feel for bigger picture an outline for investment on the midstream sites for processing primarily capacity as we look into '13 and '14 and kind of what the outlook is on the big picture basically?
367	adjudicated	1	Is that correct roughly? I mean of you adjust it for the Venezuelan and everything, zero growth next year?
490	adjudicated	1	Have you -- I guess, at this point, have you negotiated exchange contracts? If you have, can you give us a sense of what percentage maybe of the book you've maybe negotiated?
210	adjudicated	1	Is this a dry gas play in the deeper -- down the basement that you talked about?
341	adjudicated	4	Are you seeing any dynamics in terms of differential gross margin in a given region and how should we think about that?
301	adjudicated	2	Have you seen any changes year-to-date?
371	adjudicated	4	Please don't tell me you think that new home sell numbers are good data points, because new sells and the rest of the nation as may showed, I mean it's kind of silly but do you really don't believe those numbers do you?
362	adjudicated	2	Is it going to be one of those things where your customers ask for it, and then you buy it sometime after that? Or is it going to be where you're going to have a fleet of 50 or 100 or so of these 400-horsepower units on hand?
369	adjudicated	3	How would you guys handicap the likelihood of that scenario that you outlined in your slide deck playing out?
19	adjudicated	1	Is that coming from large incumbents or are you able to take over share from some smaller players, and help consolidate both electronics and seating?
